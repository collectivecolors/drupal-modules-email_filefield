1. Embed information about file submitted in the webform submission results.

2. Eliminate the possibility that a user can receive two file emails if their
email address is specified in multiple webform fields.  Need to look into
exiting hook_mail_alter() without sending an actual email to the user, while
still allowing for the continued execution of the script.

3. Make this module work for multiple file filefields.  Right now only a single 
file is supported.

4. Eliminate the dependency on the thickbox module.  The thickbox module
can be themed out of the picture but it would be best if the module did not
need it installed to operate.  If thickbox is not installed and enabled for a
field, it will default to a menu callback that redirects back to the current 
page, when submitted.  Also needs a back button.

5. Eliminate the dependency on the webform module.  The webform module is great
and all but what if we don't want the overhead.  A simple email form needs to be
generated that is used unless the webform module is installed and enabled for
the field.
